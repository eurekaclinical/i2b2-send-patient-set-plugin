i2b2 Export plugin, ${project.version} -- An i2b2 plugin for exporting patient
data from i2b2 to CSV files
Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

This is the i2b2 Export plugin, an i2b2 plugin for exporting patient data
from i2b2 to CSV files. Users can configure the format of the CSV file using the
plugin's interface, as well as save, load, and delete configurations. More
information on doing so is available in the plugin's Help tab. The plugin
communicates with i2b2's cells via the i2b2 Export Service, a RESTful
web service that routes requests from the plugin to the appropriate i2b2 cell,
as well as providing authentication.

REQUIREMENTS

This plugin requires an installation of i2b2 1.5. This plugin has only been
tested to work with i2b2 1.5. It has NOT been tested with any later versions.

It also requires the corresponding i2b2 Export Service in order to be fully
functional.

INSTALLATION

These instructions assume your i2b2 installation is rooted at /var/www/html/webclient.
This location will be referred to as $I2B2_ROOT.

1. Locate your i2b2 installation's plugins directory: $I2B2_ROOT/js-i2b2/cells/plugins.

2. Create a new directory inside the plugins directory. This directory defines
a new plugin category and will be referred to as $CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR. The 
plugin will show up under a category with the name of this directory in the 
i2b2 plugin list.

3. In cell_config_data.js, find the 'config' map and the 'category' key. Change
the last value of the 'category' array to be $CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR.

4. Copy the entire PatientDataExport directory and its contents into the directory
created in step 2, $CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR.

5. IMPORTANT: In PatientDataExport_ctrlr.js, change the value of i2b2.PatientDataExort.SERVICE_URL
variable to the location of the i2b2 Export Service's REST methods that the
plugin needs to call.

6. Modify $I2B2_ROOT/js-i2b2/i2b2_loader.js to add the plugin to the list of
plugins. Add the following JavaScript map to the i2b2.hive.tempCellsList array:

 { code: "PatientDataExport",
    forceLoading: true,
    forceConfigMsg: { params: [] },
    forceDir: "cells/plugins/$CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR"
 }

 where $CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR is the name of the directory you created in step 2
(where the plugin was copied to). Where you place this block determines the
order in which the plugin is displayed in the i2b2 plugin list.

This completes the installation of the i2b2 Export plugin.
