# I2b2 Send Patient Set Plugin
[Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (ACTSI)](http://www.actsi.org), [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu), Atlanta, GA

## What does it do?
It is an i2b2 web client plugin for exporting patient data
from i2b2 to CSV files. Users can configure the format of the CSV file using the
plugin's interface, as well as save, load, and delete configurations. More
information on doing so is available in the plugin's Help tab. The plugin
communicates with i2b2's cells via the i2b2 Export Service, a RESTful
web service that routes requests from the plugin to the appropriate i2b2 cell,
as well as providing authentication.

## Version 1.0 development series
This plugin was originally developed as part of the [i2b2-eureka](https://github.com/eurekaclinical/i2b2-eureka) project. We have split that project's modules into separate projects, including the send patient set plugin.

## Version history
No final releases yet

## Requirements
* [i2b2](http://www.i2b2.org) version 1.7
* The [Eureka! Clinical i2b2 Integration webapp](https://github.com/euerkaclinical/eurekaclinical-i2b2-integration-webapp) running on the same server.
  
## Installation
These instructions assume your i2b2 installation is rooted at /var/www/html/webclient.
This location will be referred to as $I2B2_ROOT.

1) Locate your i2b2 installation's plugins directory: `$I2B2_ROOT/js-i2b2/cells/plugins`.

2) Create a new directory inside the plugins directory. This directory defines
a new plugin category and will be referred to as `$CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR`. The 
plugin will show up under a category with the name of this directory in the 
i2b2 plugin list.

3) In `cell_config_data.js`, find the 'config' map and the 'category' key. Change
the last value of the 'category' array to be `$CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR`.

4) Inside $CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR, create a new directory, `PatientSetSender`.

5) Copy the entire directory and its contents into the `PatientSetSender` directory.

6) In PatientSetSender_config.js, change the value of `i2b2.PatientSetSender.SERVICE_URL`
variable to the URL of the Eureka! Clinical i2b2 Integration webapp.

7) In PatientSetSender_config.js, change the value of `i2b2.PatientSetSender.EUREKA_SERVICES_URL`
variable to the URL of Eureka Webapp.

8) In PatientSetSender_config.js, change the value of `i2b2.PatientSetSender.RECEIVER_DISPLAY_NAME`
variable to the display name of where to send patient set.

9) In PatientSetSender_config.js, change the value of `i2b2.PatientSetSender.RECEIVER_SEND_URL`
variable to URL of the receiving service that implements the Eureka! Clinical patient set REST API.

10) Modify `$I2B2_ROOT/js-i2b2/i2b2_loader.js` to add the plugin to the list of
plugins. Add the following JavaScript map to the `i2b2.hive.tempCellsList` array:
```
 { code: "PatientSetSender",
    forceLoading: true,
    forceConfigMsg: { params: [] },
    forceDir: "cells/plugins/$CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR"
 }
```
where `$CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR` is the name of the directory you created in step 2
(where the plugin was copied to). Where you place this block determines the
order in which the plugin is displayed in the i2b2 plugin list.

This completes the installation of the i2b2 Export plugin.
